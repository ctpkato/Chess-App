# Chess-Bot

Using Stockfish (https://stockfishchess.org), the strongest chess bot available, I made a chess application that can run a 1v1 between you and Stockfish

The libraries used is pygame and chess

Chess is a hobby near and dear to my heart, so I decided to make my first real Python project about it
